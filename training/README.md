## Model Training

This folder contains the code and dataset used to train the heart disease prediction model.

- Dataset: Large-scale heart disease dataset (~300k records)
- Algorithm: Logistic Regression
- Train-Test Split: 80% training, 20% testing
- Preprocessing: Label Encoding and Feature Scaling

The trained model (`heart_model.pkl`) and scaler (`scaler.pkl`) are exported and used in the backend Flask application for inference.
